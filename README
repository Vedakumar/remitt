REMITT stands for:
REMITT Electronic Medical Information Translation and Transmission

(It is a recursive acronym.)

It is a system for translating documents from one format to another,
then transmitting them. It was designed to be used for medical billing
and claim submission using XML files. It uses XSLT and XML, and is
written in Java as a J2EE application.

This application should be able to be dropped into a Servlet container
like Apache Tomcat and run with little to no configuration. The
system property "properties" can point at a configuration file to
override default config properties which are defined inside the war
file.

Currently the user authentication is done from conf/tomcat-users.xml in
Tomcat, so the following items would have to be added in the <tomcat-users>
element for the default authentication to work:

  <role rolename="default"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <user username="Administrator" password="password" roles="admin,default"/>

The only prerequisite for installing this software is importing the
database definitions from sql/*.sql into your working database server.

At the moment, MySQL is the supported / preferred database server.

Remote Services Information:
REST services are exposed at /remitt/services/rest/service/(functionname)
and SOAP services are available through the WSDL at
/remitt/services/interface?wsdl
