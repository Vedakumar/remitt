REMITT stands for:
REMITT Electronic Medical Information Translation and Transmission

(It is a recursive acronym.)

It is a system for translating documents from one format to another,
then transmitting them. It was designed to be used for medical billing
and claim submission using XML files. It uses XSLT and XML, and is
written in Perl.

To generate documentation using the NaturalDocs format (available at
http://www.naturaldocs.org/), go to the root of the REMITT distribution
and run

	./doc/naturaldocs/src/generate.sh

with NaturalDocs installed in /usr/share/naturaldocs.
