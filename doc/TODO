Plugin
	Authentication
		* SQLite plugin [done]
	Render
		XSLT
		* Base class [done]
		* Gather options from actual XSL files [done]

		* Dummy transport plugins (to Text and PDF files) [done]
		* FreeClaims.com transport [done]
		* Extend to return results from external validation?
	Validation
		* Add validation plugin class
		* Use XSL to process initial XML file for validiation before
		  execute is called
XSL
	* Proof of concept test XSL [done]
	* 837p.xsl - Rewrite looping logic in 837p to be smarter.
	* hcfa1500.xsl [done]
	* ub92.xsl - Add UB92 form support.
	* Make more <xsl:message> tags so that things are actually logged.
	* Output buffering for anything that needs it so that we can move
	  to semi-sane logging
FreeMED
	class.Remitt.php
		* Create XML export [done]
		* XML-RPC interface routines, like class.FreeB_v1.php [done]
	freeb.billing.module.php
		* Create clone of this class for Remitt or interchangable
		  backends. [done]
		* Create options to view logs.
		* Create some sort of sorting or pagination for large numbers
		  of output files, or give the option to "archive" old files
		  to a directory or something ... this sounds like REMITT
		  needs more XML-RPC functions to handle this.
